And finally the super-complex feature - you can add to GH and check later if u wish. its this: once N tiles are ADJACENTS they create an island of adjacency (it could be 2, or 4, or even a weird L shape or more complex. As long as an "island" of 4-connected tiles are being DRAG AND DROPPED, they have to stay together.This is valid for tyhe part you move. if you BREAK an island landing on it, so be it (this is necessary or i believe we might have some puzzles UNSOLVABLE). when you move a full island, use some way to determine how the landed-upon tiles go to the source location - I trust you and i dont care much.
